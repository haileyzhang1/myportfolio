		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Animates is a fun, goal-oriented app that guides the conversation of 
			the users and helps them strengthen relationships with friends and family.</p>

		<p>During the current epidemic, people have had more time to stay connected, 
			yet they feel more removed with their friends and loved ones. It is 
			harder to stay in touch due to the lack of conversational topic and 
			general lack of change in people’s daily lives. Our team designed an app 
			that helps people reignite old relationships that may have been affected 
			through quarantine and rebuild relationships with friends through a fun, 
			goal-oriented game that guides the conversations of the users.</p>
		<h2>Background Research</h2>
		<p>The first step of our design process is to conduct online and community 
			research to observe and narrow the problems stakeholders are experiencing. 
			Before doing research we decided on four focuses: mental health, entertainment, 
			how people/students were reacting to the coronavirus, and relationships during the coronavirus.</p>
		
		<h2>Overall Findings</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Quarantine is not helpful to mental health.</li>
				<li>People are becoming less motivated, procrastinating more frequently, having issues with creating a new routine.</li>
				<li>There are applications that exist but people may become bored with them after using them a few times</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>In-depth Interview</h2>
		<p>We conducted 8 in-depth interviews with primary and secondary stakeholders to gain more insights on
			their experiences and thoughts upon quarantine and their relationships with family members and friends.</p>
		<h3>Important Findings</h3>
		<h4>General feelings towards quarantine</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Many stakeholders we interviewed reveal that they feel anxious and depressed at the 
				beginning of quarantine and gradually adapted to the environment.</li>
			<li>Many stakeholders express their feeling of fatigue of being stuck at an isolated environment.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Relationship with family and friends</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Stakeholders’ have developed a stronger relationship with people they are living with or close 
				to while their relationships with friends that are not so close (classmates & other peers) have 
				deteriorated.</li>
			<li>Many stakeholders express their loneliness and their desire for social interaction with friends 
				and with new people. It’s difficult to build new connections with people during quarantine.</li>
			<li>Stakeholders express their concern over the lack of diverse activities and new topics in conversations
				to bond with family and friends.</li>
		</ul>
